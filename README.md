## 📌 About The Project

VibeSync is a realtime video conferencing platform that allows users to securely sign in with Google, create instant meeting rooms, and communicate using peer-to-peer streaming.

The application uses WebRTC for audio/video transmission and Socket.io as a signaling server to establish live connections between participants. The system is built with a modern React frontend and Node.js backend to provide smooth real-time communication.
